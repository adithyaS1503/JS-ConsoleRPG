This project is my dead horse. I started it with the intention of learning and getting comfortable with JS and I think I've reached that point. 

I'm not going to develop anything past the Guard encounter ie area 0. All the assets are here, there're guides to the mechanics and story, anyone 
can take this and expand it, that's the beauty of open-source after all.
