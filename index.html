                You, a knight, return back to your village after being sent out on a long mission only to find all the villagers
slaughtered by the Forlorn King. He intends to commune with the outer Gods and is on the verge of executing his 
ritual. You make your way to the Castle grounds only to find the army slaughtered as well, only a handful of the
kinds truest remain to carry out his bidding. You must stop him before it's too late.
