                <li>You always have the first action.</li>
                <li>Your character has 20 Health and 10 Stamina. Your Stamina regens to 10 each round.</li>
                <li>If your Stamina falls below 0-3 in a round, you take additional damage.</li>
                <li>You can choose between: Attack, Heavy-Attack, Block or to Forego a round.</li>
                <li>Attacks do 0-10 damage and Heavy-Attacks do 0-15 damage. Yes, you can roll a 0 and miss.</li>
                <li>Your block negated 5 damage. But, being defensive constantly has it's own drawbacks.</li>
                <li>Reach the Forlorn King before round 30 or risk dooming the World.</li>
