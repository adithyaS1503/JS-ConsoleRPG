# A Knight's Honor - A Turn-Based RPG 

A Knight's Honor is a game whose mechanics were implemented entirely in JavaScript.
Currently, the game is played exclusively through the console but there are plans to further expand it by adding character-sprites, backgrounds, effects, etc.

NOTE: This project is no longer actively being worked on.
